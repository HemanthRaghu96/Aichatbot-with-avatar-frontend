# AIChatBot with avatar frontend

 I’m excited to share with you a project I’ve recently developed—a cutting-edge voice-interactive chatbot. Here’s a rundown of what I’ve accomplished:

Avatar Integration: I’ve set up an account with [D-iD], integrating their API to provide instant, realistic avatars for our chatbot.

Natural Language Processing: For the chatbot’s language capabilities, I’ve utilized [Gemini]—a powerful LLM with free API access that enhances the chatbot's conversational skills.

Voice Interaction: This project features a natural user interface where interaction occurs through voice. It’s designed to make conversations seamless and intuitive.

Innovative Topics: I’ve designed the chatbot to be open-ended.

Hands-Free Design: I’ve implemented a hands-free interface, considering how to detect when users finish speaking and when the avatar should respond. This ensures a smooth and natural conversation flow.

Simple UI: The user interface is clean and minimalistic.

Tech Stack: The project uses React, TailwindCSS for styling, TypeScript for a robust, typesafe development experience. The code is written in TSX, ensuring top-notch error handling and readability.
